In the case of a refinance mortgage loan, the ratio is obtained by dividing the original mortgage loan amount on the note date plus any secondary mortgage loan amount disclosed by the Seller by the mortgaged property's appraised value on the note date.  If the secondary financing amount disclosed by the Seller includes a home equity line of credit, then the CLTV calculation reflects the disbursed amount at closing of the first lien mortgage loan, not the maximum loan amount available under the home equity line of credit.  In the case of a seasoned mortgage loan, if the Seller cannot warrant that the value of the mortgaged property has not declined since the note date, Freddie Mac requires that the Seller must provide a new appraisal value, which is used in the CLTV calculation.

If a Third Party Origination is applicable, but the Seller does not specify Broker or Correspondent, the disclosure will indicate ""TPO Not Specified"". Similarly, if neither Third Party Origination nor Retail designations are available, the disclosure will indicate ""TPO Not Specified."" If a Broker, Correspondent or Third Party Origination disclosure is not applicable, the mortgage loan will be designated as Retail, as defined below. Broker is a person or entity that specializes in loan originations, receiving a commission (from a Correspondent or other lender) to match Borrowers and lenders. The Broker performs some or most of the loan processing functions, such as taking loan applications, or ordering credit reports, appraisals and title reports. Typically, the Broker does not underwrite or service the mortgage loan and generally does not use its own funds for closing; however, if the Broker funded a mortgage loan on a lender's behalf, such a mortgage loan is considered a ""Broker"" third party origination mortgage loan.
The mortgage loan is generally closed in the name of the lender who commissioned the Broker's services.
Correspondent is an entity that typically sells the Mortgages it originates to other lenders, which are not Affiliates of that entity, under a specific commitment or as part of an ongoing relationship. The Correspondent performs some, or all, of the loan processing functions, such as: taking the loan application; ordering credit reports, appraisals, and title reports; and verifying the Borrower's income and  employment. The Correspondent may or may not have delegated underwriting and typically funds the mortgage loans at settlement. The mortgage loan is closed in the Correspondent's name and the Correspondent may or may not service the mortgage loan. The Correspondent may use a Broker to perform some of the processing functions or even to fund the loan on its behalf; under such circumstances, the mortgage loan is considered a ""Broker"" third party origination mortgage loan, rather than a ""Correspondent"" third party origination mortgage loan.
Retail Mortgage is a mortgage loan that is originated, underwritten and funded by a lender or its Affiliates. The mortgage loan is closed in the name of the lender or its Affiliate and if it is sold to Freddie Mac, it is sold by the lender or its Affiliate that originated it. A mortgage loan that a Broker or Correspondent completely or partially originated, processed, underwrote, packaged, funded or closed is not considered a Retail mortgage loan.
For purposes of the definitions of Correspondent and Retail, ""Affiliate"" means any entity that is related to another party as a consequence of the entity, directly or indirectly, controlling the other party, being controlled by the other party, or being under common control with the other party.","R = Retail

Generally, a Cash-out Refinance mortgage loan is a mortgage loan in which the use of the loan amount is not limited to specific purposes. A mortgage loan placed on a property previously owned free and clear by the Borrower is always considered a Cash-out Refinance mortgage loan.  Generally, a No Cash-out Refinance mortgage loan is a mortgage loan in which the loan amount is limited to the following uses:
Pay off the first mortgage, regardless of its age
Pay off any junior liens secured by the mortgaged property, that were used in their entirety to acquire the subject property
Pay related closing costs, financing costs and prepaid items, and Disburse cash out to the Borrower (or any other payee) not to exceed 2% of the new refinance mortgage loan or $2,000, whichever is less.
As an exception to the above, for construction conversion mortgage loans and renovation mortgage loans, the amount of the interim construction financing secured by the mortgaged property is considered an amount used to pay off the first mortgage. Paying off unsecured liens or construction costs paid by the Borrower outside of the secured interim construction financing is considered cash out to the Borrower, if greater than $2000 or 2% of loan amount.
